ZeWhat?
-------

Based on the previous success of the `ZeAppp`-app, this app will be the same but different: 
We'll start with a base app and have several tasks sprinkled out in the code base. 
If you are at the booth, please look behind on the wall for the current tasks list, or feel free to add your own. 
We don't have a project manager yet, so feel free to use your 15 min time slot wisely.
